                "Genius", "Kreideprinz", or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.<br>
                The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire - acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars."<br>
