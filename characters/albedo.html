            <p>Albedo is a synthetic human made by the alchemist Rhinedottir. He is the Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius, through a recommendation from the adventurer Alice. With <a class="anemo" href="/characters/sucrose.html">Sucrose</a> as his assistant, he holds an infinite desire to learn about the world of Teyvate, carefully studying every object around him.</p>

                    The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire - acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.<span class="geo">"</span><br>

                Having gained fame for his alchemical talents, Albedo is a reclusive person, spending most of his time in Dragonspine. He dislikes most social interactions, finding it stressful, and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. He prefers being around children, especially <a href="klee.html" class="pyro">Klee</a>, seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.<br><br>
                Fueled by the feeling of enlightenment, he researches about the things that pique his interest, and once the feeling is gone (either by uncovering the truth or otherwise), he loses all interest, left with a bittersweet sensation in his mind.<br>
                Along with his alchemical genius, Albedo is also a respectable artist. Having initially learned the talent as a way to help with his experiments, it is now a form of relaxation for him. He is <a href="xingqiu.html" class="hydro">Xingqiu</a>'s illustrator and regards him as a good author.<br>
                <br>
                As much of a positive demeanor as he gives off, the people of Mondstadt do not know anything about his personal life, and he is particularly secretive about it towards them. To the Traveler, he does not mind sharing most of his secrets with them, due to feeling a kinship of sorts, as they are both not of Teyvat. He considers himself to be dangerous, due to his knowledge on the art of Khemia, something which Venti and Dainsleif are well too aware of.
